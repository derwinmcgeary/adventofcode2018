# Advent of Code 2018 - day1

Solving (https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1)[puzzle one here] To run, `go run programname.go`. The program expects the input to be in a file called `input` and outputs only the answers to the day's challenge.

This is first attempt at using Go, and I would welcome any
hints on how I'm doing things bass-ackwards!
